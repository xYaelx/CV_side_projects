This is an on-going project and it will be built in steps. 
First, the aim is to classify different emotions from facial expressions images and the second stage will be 
a transfer learning on a specific data set with a typical attribute (TBD).

The project written in Python (mainly Pytorch but also a bit of TensorFlow) and we are going to use ResNet18.

The datasets we are going to use:
Challenges in Representation Learning: Facial Expression Recognition Challenge

Face Dataset with Age, Emotion, Ethnicity

Facial Expression of Emotion(only women images) - probably for the transfer learning
